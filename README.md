Repository for Module 21 Assignment

This repo contains the two Jupyter Notebook files for the assignment. The requested h5 exports and the final write up report in a word doc. 

As a note, I had to recreate this repo because an error happened in the first one I made. This is why there are only 2 total commits because all the work was done on the old repo that I deleted.
